## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Backend-first for M1 — validates core agent loop before investing in UI
- Init: LLM is intent-only; orchestrator dispatches all actions — enforced structurally from Phase 3
- Init: Precomputed briefing cache is architectural default, not an optimisation — baked into Phase 2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: APScheduler 4.x is pre-release — verify stability at Phase 2 start; pin 3.10.x if unstable
- Phase 5: End-to-end latency benchmarking under real-world noise conditions — Silero VAD tuning may require iteration
